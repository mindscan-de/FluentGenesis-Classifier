# FluentGenesis-Classifier

## The basic Idea

I want to clasify SourceCode with a CNN. Later do some work with CNN + RNN. After that I want to work
on Source-Code-Generation. Let's call my first goal "SC(L)U" (Source Code (Language) Understanding) in
comparison to NLU (Natural Language Understanding).

## Some Pointers and reminders

* Use natural language embeddings like glove.6b.300d.txt -> better understand variable names / method names
* Some Architecture on classifying source code / text
